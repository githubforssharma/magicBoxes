# magicBoxes

This is a very interesting program I wrote in Java where you are displayed 6 boxes - each box has 32 numbers and those numbers are between 1 and 63. All you need to do is think of a number between 1 and 63. And tell the program which boxes your number is in. The program does its magic and prints out the number you thought of!

I have also added a recorded video of the program which shows how the program works. Open Issues - If the user inputs an alphabet or a negative number or a number with decimals the program will fail. I will be working on fixing those issues soon.
